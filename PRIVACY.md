## 1. Information We Access
When you authorize the App through Airtable OAuth, we may access:

- Metadata such as field names and table structure

We **do not** access:

## 3. Data Storage
- Data is processed only temporarily on the server when needed.
- No Airtable data is permanently stored outside your Airtable base.
- OAuth tokens are stored securely and used only to communicate with Airtable on your behalf.

## 4. Third-Party Services
This App interacts only with:
- **Airtable API** (for OAuth authorization and record operations)

## 5. Security
We take reasonable measures to protect your data, including:
